            pilot transitioning into a career in full stack software engineering. 
            I have been building websites since the late 1990s and have experience leveraging technology to 
            start, manage and grow businesses in the real estate and publishing fields. 
            I enjoy almost anything to do with aviation, and love spending time with my family including: 
            riding horses, hiking, traveling, gardening, attending Scottish festivals, or just visiting on the front
            porch!
